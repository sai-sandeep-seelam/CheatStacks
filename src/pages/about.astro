    <h1>About CheatStack</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      CheatStack is a modern, fast, and static cheatsheet website designed for developers.
      It is inspired by Devhints and aims to provide a quick reference for various programming languages, tools, and frameworks.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why CheatStack?</h2>
    <p>
        We wanted a cheatsheet site that is extremely fast, works offline (via service workers in future), and has a modern, clean interface. 
        Using <strong>Astro</strong> allows us to ship zero JavaScript for content by default, making the site load instantly.
